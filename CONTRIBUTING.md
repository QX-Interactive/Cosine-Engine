<h1 align="center">Contributing to Cosine Engine</h1>

## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Cosine Engine project. We hope we can make something interesting and cool with this project!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing
this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you
finalize your pull requests.

Currently, we are not looking for any contributions to our code, but you can help us with finding errors in our documentation and reporting bugs!

## Ground Rules
- Be welcoming to newcomers and be supportive to each other. If someone has made a mistake or can do something better, please give clear feedback on how to solve it or how to do it better. We all can learn new things :-);
- If you have a question or issue, please use clear descriptive language to explain it. This allows other people to help you with your problem quicker!

## Your First Contribution

## How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [security@qxinteractive.com](mailto:security@qxinteractive.com) instead. For all the other bugs, please submit an issue ticket to the issue tracker.

When filing an issue for a code problem, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of C++ are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

When filing an issue for a non-code problem (documentation), make sure to answer these three questions:
1. In what file/page do you see the issue?
2. What sentence is wrong on the page? Cite the sentence + line number.
3. What should it be changed to?

General questions should go to the discussion form in this repository instead of the issue tracker.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement
The Cosine Engine project philosophy is to provide a small 2D engine build with SFML and C++ for multiplayer games.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that does not exist in the engine, you are probably not alone.
There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open a new discussion on the discussion board on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process
The core team will try to look at the PR's made on a weekly basis. Due to us still attending university we will not be available all the time.

## Community
Discord link is coming soon.
